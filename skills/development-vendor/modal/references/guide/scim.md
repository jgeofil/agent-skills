</Callout>

[SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643)
is a protocol that identity providers (IdPs) use to automate user management in
connected apps.

Modal supports SCIM for automatic provisioning and deprovisioning of users and
[user groups](/docs/guide/user-groups).

## Prerequisites

* A Workspace that's on an [Enterprise](/pricing) plan, with SCIM enabled
* The Workspace Owner or Workspace Manager Role in the Workspace you want to
  configure with SCIM
* Admin privileges for your IdP

## Connecting an IdP

### Step 1: Generate a SCIM token

1. Open the **Identity and Provisioning** tab on the
   [Workspace Management settings page](/settings/workspace-management/identity-and-provisioning).
   If SCIM is enabled for your Workspace, a **SCIM Tokens** section appears
   below the **Single Sign-On (SSO)** section. If you don't see it, contact
   <support@modal.com> to enable SCIM for your
   Workspace.
2. Click **New SCIM Token**, then click **Create Token**.
3. Copy the value from the **Token Secret** box and store it somewhere secure.
   The dialog also shows the **SCIM Endpoint** URL for your Workspace, which
   some IdPs require.

   This is the only time Modal shows the token secret. After you click **Done**,
   you can't view it again; if you lose it, generate a new token.

### Step 2: IdP configuration

#### Okta

**Supported features**

The [Modal app](https://www.okta.com/integrations/modal/) in the Okta
Integration Network (OIN) supports the following provisioning features:

* Create users
* Update user attributes
* Deactivate users
* Group push

The Modal app doesn't support the following features:

* Import users
* Import groups
* Sync password
* Profile sourcing

For more information on the listed features, visit the
[Okta Glossary](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie\&id=ext_glossary).

Pushed groups appear as [user groups](/docs/guide/user-groups) in Modal. Group
names must be unique within a Workspace, ignoring case, across both custom and
SCIM groups, so a group push fails if a group with the same name already exists.
See [Group name conflicts](/docs/guide/user-groups#group-name-conflicts) for
how to resolve this.

**Configuration steps**

1. Add the Modal app to Okta.

   If you already use the Modal app for [Okta SSO](/docs/guide/okta-sso),
   select it in the Okta Admin Console under **Applications > Applications** and
   continue to step 2. Otherwise, add it from the Okta Integration Network:

   1. In the Okta Admin Console, go to **Applications > Applications** and click
      **Browse App Catalog**.
   2. Select **Modal** and click **Done**.
   3. Select the **Sign On** tab and click **Edit**.
   4. Enter your Modal Workspace name in the **Workspace** field and click
      **Save**. Your Workspace name is shown under **Workspace Name** on the
      **Identity and Provisioning** tab of the
      [Workspace Management settings page](/settings/workspace-management/identity-and-provisioning).

2. Configure the app with your Modal SCIM credentials.

   Select the **Provisioning** tab, click **Configure API Integration**, select
   **Enable API integration**, and enter:

   | Okta setting | Modal value                             |
   | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
   | API Token    | The full SCIM token generated in step 1 |

   Click **Test API Credentials**, then click **Save**.

3. Enable provisioning to Modal.

   On the **Provisioning** tab, select **To App** and click **Edit**. Enable
   **Create Users**, **Update User Attributes**, and **Deactivate Users**, then
   click **Save**.

4. Assign users and groups.

   Select the **Assignments** tab and assign the people and groups that Okta
   should provision to Modal. Modal identifies users by email address, so keep
   the **Application username format** on the **Sign On** tab set to **Email**.

5. Push groups.

   Select the **Push Groups** tab, click **Push Groups**, and select the groups
   whose membership Okta should sync to Modal.

   For more information, see Okta's
   [provisioning documentation](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/provisioning/lcm/lcm-provision-application.htm).

#### Microsoft Entra ID

1. Create or select an enterprise application.

   In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/):

   * If you already have a Modal enterprise application that you use for
     [Microsoft Entra SSO](/docs/guide/entra-sso), you can reuse it for SCIM
     provisioning. Go to **Entra ID > Enterprise apps** and select the
     application.
   * Otherwise, go to **Entra ID > Enterprise apps** and create an application:
     1. Select **New application > Create your own application**.
     2. Enter a name such as `Modal SCIM`.
     3. Select **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery
        (Non-gallery)** and create the application.

2. Configure the application with your Modal SCIM credentials.

   Open the enterprise application, select **Provisioning > New configuration**,
   and enter the following values. Replace `<workspace>` with your Modal
   Workspace name.

   | Entra setting | Modal value                                 |
   | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
   | Tenant URL    | `https://modal.com/api/<workspace>/scim/v2` |
   | Secret Token  | The full SCIM token generated in step 1     |

   Select **Test Connection**, then create the provisioning configuration.
   Review the user attribute mappings and ensure that an email address is mapped
   to `userName`. Assign the users and groups that Entra should provision, then
   select **Start provisioning**.

   For more information, see Microsoft's
   [SCIM provisioning documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups#integrate-your-scim-endpoint-with-the-microsoft-entra-provisioning-service).

#### Other IdPs

1. Create a custom SCIM integration.

   Create a custom or non-gallery application that supports outbound SCIM 2.0
   provisioning. Name it something recognizable, such as `Modal SCIM`. An
   existing SSO integration can continue to handle authentication; whether the
   SCIM integration must be a separate app depends on your IdP.

2. Configure the integration with your Modal SCIM credentials.

   Find your IdP's equivalent settings and enter the following values.
   Replace `<workspace>` with your Modal Workspace name.

   | Setting                | Modal value                                 |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
   | SCIM version           | 2.0                                         |
   | SCIM base URL          | `https://modal.com/api/<workspace>/scim/v2` |
   | Authorization method   | Bearer token                                |
   | Token                  | The full SCIM token generated in step 1     |
   | Unique user identifier | Email address in `userName`                 |

   Enable creating, updating, and deactivating users. You can also enable group
   provisioning. Test the connection, assign the users and groups that your IdP
   should provision, and start provisioning.

Modal supports the following SCIM capabilities:

| Capability                         | Supported | Notes                         |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| SCIM 2.0                           | Yes       |                               |
| Pagination                         | Yes       |                               |
| Create, update, and remove users   | Yes       |                               |
| Create, update, and delete groups  | Yes       |                               |
| Update group membership with PATCH | Yes       |                               |
| Generate temporary passwords       | No        | Modal authentication uses SSO |

Your IdP may also ask which user attributes Modal supports:

| SCIM user attribute | Modal support | Notes                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| externalId          | Yes           |                                                 |
| userName            | Yes           | Required; must contain the user's email address |
| displayName         | Yes           | Not displayed in the UI                         |
| name.familyName     | Yes           | Not displayed in the UI                         |
| name.givenName      | Yes           | Not displayed in the UI                         |
| emails              | Read-only     | The primary email is derived from `userName`    |
| active              | Yes           |                                                 |
| addresses           | No            |                                                 |
| profileUrl          | No            |                                                 |

## Managing tokens

Only Workspace Owners and Workspace Managers can manage SCIM tokens.

Up to two SCIM tokens can be active at a time, so you can rotate tokens without
dropping updates:

1. Generate a new token.
2. Replace the old token with the new one in your IdP.
3. Revoke the old token.

Outside of a rotation, keep only one SCIM token active as a security best
practice.

## Troubleshooting

### Your IdP can't authenticate with Modal

Confirm that you copied the full token. It has the form
`si-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:ss-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.

### A group push fails with an "already exists" error

Your Workspace already has a group with the same name, ignoring case. Group
names must be unique across custom and SCIM groups, so rename one of the
conflicting groups before retrying the push. See
[Group name conflicts](/docs/guide/user-groups#group-name-conflicts) for
details.
