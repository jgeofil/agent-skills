title: app-architecture
description: Plan your system architecture before you start building. Covers data model, API design, auth, integrations, and deployment — everything an AI coding agent needs to scaffold your app correctly from the start.
---

# Instructions

- Write this as a technical blueprint that an AI coding assistant or engineer could use to scaffold the entire application.
- Be opinionated about technology choices — pick specific tools and explain why.
- Data models should list actual fields with types. API routes should specify methods, paths, and payloads.
- Auth should name the exact provider and flow. Keep it practical and buildable, not theoretical.

---

## 1. System Overview (Required)

What the app does in 2-3 sentences, who it is for, and the high-level architecture.

### Architecture Pattern

- **Type**: Monolith / Microservices / Serverless / Jamstack
- **Key components**: Frontend, Backend API, Database, Background Jobs, External Services

### System Diagram

Describe how the major pieces connect:

- which services talk to each other
- what protocols they use (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- where data flows

---

## 2. Data Model (Required)

Define every core entity with its fields, types, and relationships.

### Entity Format

```text
User
- **id**: uuid (PK)
- **email**: text (unique)
- **name**: text
- **role**: enum (admin, member)
- **createdAt**: timestamptz
```

### Relationships

- **User → Project**: One-to-many (user has many projects)
- **Project → Organization**: Many-to-one (project belongs to org)
- **User ↔ Organization**: Many-to-many (via Membership join table)
Note: which fields are indexed and any unique constraints beyond primary keys.

---

## 3. API Design (Required)

List every API route grouped by resource.

### Format

```text
METHOD /api/path
Auth: required | public
Body: { field: type, ... }
Response: { field: type, ... }
```

### Example

```text
POST /api/projects
Auth: required
Body: { name: string, description?: string }
Response: { id, name, description, createdAt }
GET /api/projects/:id
Auth: required
Response: { id, name, description, members: [...]}
```

Note rate limiting, pagination approach, and error response format

---

## 4. Auth & Permissions (Required)

### Authentication

- **Provider**: e.g., Clerk, NextAuth, Supabase Auth
- **Methods**: Magic link, OAuth (Google, GitHub), email/password
- **Session handling**: JWT tokens, cookie sessions, etc.

### Authorization

- **Roles**: List each role and its capabilities
- **Enforcement**: How auth is checked (middleware, per-route, RLS)
- **Public routes**: Which pages/endpoints don't require auth

### Multi-tenancy If applicable: how organizations/workspaces are scoped and how data isolation works

---

## 5. Third-Party Services (Required)

List every external service the app depends on.

### Format For each service

- **Service**: What it does
- **SDK/Library**: Which package to use
- **Config**: Key environment variables and setup
- **Failure handling**: What happens when this service is down

### Common Services

- **Payments**: Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, etc.
- **Email**: Resend, SendGrid, Postmark
- **File storage**: S3, Cloudflare R2, Uploadthing
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Replicate
- **Analytics**: PostHog, Mixpanel, Segment
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, LogRocket

---

## 6. Frontend Architecture (Required)

### Tech Choices

- **Framework**: Next.js, Vite + React, SvelteKit, etc.
- **Component library**: shadcn/ui, Radix, Material UI, etc.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, styled-components
- **State management**: React Query, Zustand, Redux, etc.

### Page Structure List every page/route with its path and purpose

- `/` — Landing or dashboard
- `/app` — Main application
- `/settings` — User/org settings

### Data Fetching Strategy

- Server components vs. client components
- Caching and revalidation approach
- Global loading and error state handling

---

## 7. Infrastructure & Deployment (Required)

### Hosting

- **Frontend**: Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.
- **Backend**: Same as frontend / Railway / Fly.io / AWS
- **Database**: Neon, Supabase, PlanetScale, RDS

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Build and test steps
- Preview deployments for PRs
- Production deployment trigger (merge to main, manual, etc.)

### Environments

- **Development**: Local setup, seed data
- **Staging**: Config and purpose
- **Production**: Config, monitoring, alerts

### Environment Variables

List all required env vars by category (auth, database, services, feature flags).
Note which are secret vs. public
